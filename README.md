This is my first MEAN Stack project made for my studies at the Technion. For this ptoject i am creating a Task Manager app using Angular as a client, Node.JS and Express as a Server and MongoDB as a DataBase. On this app we have users with personal details as Name, Email, Adress (City, Street, ZipCode). 
Every user has tasks and posts. Upside there is a search bar that allows us to find a user by his name or email. When a user is selected, his tasks and posts appears on the right side of the app. There we can manage the tasks and post. The user can mark a task as completed. If all his tasks are completed, his section will be colored in green, else it'll be red and it means he still have some tasks to achieve. When the mouse is over the "Other Data" section, it shows more details about the user. On the app there are Add buttons which are used to create new users, tasks or posts. 

The languages i used for this project are:
- HTML
- JavaScript
- CSS
- TypeScript

Here are some screenshots from the project (August 19th 2021):
